# State_capital_quizz
Here we go for quiz.
I have written the code to play the state and their respective capital guessing game.
It's very simple.

Step 1. Please give the 1st command line argument as file_name before executing this code.

Step 2. Randomly any state name will popup and you need to guess the capital. If correct you will get 1 point and there is not negetive marking

Step 3. Type  'Quit' to exit from console anytime.

Thanks!
